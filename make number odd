/*
Given a number n. Print the minimum positive integer by which it should be divided so that the result is an odd number.

Input:

First line of the input will contain the number of test cases. 

Each test case will contain a single integer n
 

Output:
Print the required output.

Constraints:

1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 100000

Example:

Input: 
3
36
5
8

Output:
4
1
8

Explanation:

In the first case, 36 must be divided by 4 or 12 to make it odd.
We take minimum of 4 and 12 i.e. 4
In the second case, 5 is already odd.
In the third case, 8 must be divided by 8 to make it an odd number.
