/*
Implement a Queue using 2 stacks s1 and s2 .

Input Format:
The first line of the input contains an integer 'T' denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.
First line of each test case contains an integer Q denoting the number of queries . 
A Query Q is of 2 Types
(i) 1 x (a query of this type means  pushing 'x' into the queue)
(ii) 2   (a query of this type means to pop element from queue and print the poped element)
The second line of each test case contains Q queries seperated by space.

Output Format:
The output for each test case will  be space separated integers having -1 if the queue is empty else the element poped out from the
queue . 
You are required to complete the two methods push which take one argument an integer 'x' to be pushed into the quee and pop which 
returns a integer poped out from other queue.

Your Task:
Since this is a function problem, you don't need to take inputs. Just complete the provided functions. The printing is done automatically
by the driver code.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= Q <= 100
1 <= x <= 100

Example:
Input
2
5
1 2 1 3 2 1 4 2
4
1 2 2 2 1 4
Output
2 3
2 -1

Explanation:
Testcase1:
1 2    the quee will be {2}
1 3    the queue will be {2 3}
2       poped element will be 2 the queue will be {3}
1 4    the queue will be {3 4}
2       poped element will be 3
