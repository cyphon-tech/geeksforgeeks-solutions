/*
A number is said to be a magic number, if the sum of its digits are calculated till a single digit recursively by adding the sum of the
digits after every addition. If the single digit comes out to be 1,then the number is a magic number.

Input:
First line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. First line of each test case contains an integer N.
 

Output:
For each of the test case print whether the number N is "Magic" or "Not Magic"


Constraints:
1 <= T <= 105
1 <= N <= 105


Example:

Input:
2
1234
67

Output
Magic
Not Magic

Explanation:
1234 sums up to 10 which sums upto 1 so its a Magic Number.
67 sums up to 11 which sums upto 2 so its not a Magic Number
