/*
Given an array of names (consisting of lowercase characters) of candidates in an election. A candidate name in array represents a vote casted 
to the candidate. Print the name of candidate that received Max votes. If there is tie, print lexicographically smaller name.

Input:
The first line of the input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then T test case follows. Each testcase contains
two lines:-
The number of votes cast N
The name of the candidates separated by a space. Each name represents one vote casted to that candidate.

Output:
For each testcase, print the name of the candidate with the maximum votes, and also print the votes casted for the candidate. The name and
votes are separated by a space.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 105

Example:
Input:
2
13
john johnny jackie johnny john jackie jamie jamie john johnny jamie johnny john
3
andy blake clark

Output:
john 4
andy 1

Explanation:
Testcase1: john has 4 votes casted for him, but so does johny. john is lexicographically smaller, so we print john and the votes he received.
Testcase2: All the candidates get 1 votes each. We print andy as it is lexicographically smaller.
